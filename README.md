wtfit
=====

A tool for parsing and summarizing running activity from FIT files.  Currently
only works with files generated by Garmin Forerunner 225, which is the only
FIT-capable device I have.

Dump
----

    ./fit.py activity.fit

This will parse and dump the content of `activity.fit` in human-readable format.

Summarize
---------

    ./summarize.py summary.csv activity1.fit activity2.fit ...

This will generate `summary.csv` with fields:
- started
- sport
- steps
- kcal
- speed.avg
- hr.avg
- hr.max
- cad.avg
- duration
- distance
